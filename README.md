# Comparative Analysis of Babesia and Berrolia bacterium in the Investigation of Lyme Disease
With the goal of understanding the similarities between Babesia and Borrelia burgdorferi in mind, we chose to utilize the power of bioinformatics. 

We did different methodologies to find simlarities
- GC Content Analysis
- Base Composition Analysis
- Finding ORFs and Dotplot Comparison Analysis
- Finding ORFs that showed minor signs of overlap
- Pairwise Alignments
- Protein Analysis
- Phylogenetic Tree

## Observation
Most of the comparisons made between the Borrelia and Babesia sequences of our choice yielded little similarities, albeit small overlaps were observed between potential genes in similar nucleotide positions. Among all the phases of the project, the phylogenetic tree produced the most apparent results, not only showing strong confidence values between at least one Borrelia-babesia pair, but also revealing a potent ancestral link shared between the ixodes scapularis and the rest of the Borrelia-babesia tree.
